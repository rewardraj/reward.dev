## Features

- **Reusable Components**: The project includes a variety of reusable components in the `src/components` directory

- **Custom Hooks**: The project uses custom hooks to encapsulate logic that is not immediately related to the UI

- **TypeScript**: The project is written in TypeScript, which adds static types to JavaScript and provides a better development experience.

- **Vite**: The project uses Vite for a faster and leaner development experience. Vite provides a faster server start, faster hot module replacement (HMR), and more efficient production bundling.

- **Styling**: The project uses SCSS for styling.
